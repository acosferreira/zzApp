Rails 5.2.4

## Initial Thoughts
Create a model that will store the layout to each employer and the position of desired data (could be the name of columns?!)
On save earning, get the layout associated with that employee and read the file. As the date can be out of format, the date will call the method to format from string to date.
Due internet issues :/ I could not do a reasearch to improve my code.
